# Learn Go With Tests

## Background

This repository contains the code I wrote while working through @quii's [Learn Go with Tests book](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/). If you're new to Golang, I highly recommend the book. It effectively guides you in learning the language and provides practical experience using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
